    <h2>More Information on Evolutionary Computing</h2>
    <p>
        Today, evolutionary computing has many applications. Effectively any process in which multiple criteria are being maximized can be modeled
        to some extent using evolutionary computing methods. Applying evolutionary computing in this context is a relatively straight-forward
        process. The thing being optimized must first be modeled as an agent. For example, in my experience the allocation of Teaching Assistants
        to different lab sections was modeled as an array in which each TA was represented with a column and each section was represented as a row.
        Ones represented TA assignment and zeros indicated that the TA was not assigned to that section. Once there is a sufficient model, the model
        altered or mutated by the program. Then, these mutated versions are scored. If there are multiple criteria, then the criteria scores must be
        rated with respect to one another or only pareto efficient agents or solutions (agents for which there is no other agent that outperforms it
        in all criteria) can be removed. This process is then repeated until there remain only a few optimal solutions.

        Evolutionary computing has not grown to the incredible prominence that other subfields of AI have, but still holds great promise for innovation.
        Evolutionary computing is also uniquely applicable to an great variety of problems and, while perhaps compute-intensive, is relatively easy to
        implement a simple version of if the problem can be easily modeled.
