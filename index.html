    <p>
    Evolutionary computing is a field of computer science
    which seeks to imitate biological evolution to devise
    novel solutions which are not easily derived through
    more conventional, less random ways.

    The field of elements of evolutionary computing have been
    prevalent in the world of artifical intelligence since the
    1950s and 1960s, but evolutionary computing only gained
    significant recognition in the 1990s.
    
    Much of the most prevalent work in evolutionary computing seeks
    to investigate biological evolutionary processes, but the
    field is by no means limited to the study of biological processes
    like populations of chromosomes. Most of the biological work
    seeks to directly model the biological processes of recombination,
    mutation, and selective pressure. One notable early example of
    non-biological applications is the work of Ingo Rechenberg
    and Hans-Paul Schewefel. In this work the two solved a fluid
    dynamics problem which could not be solved using traditional
    mathematical approaches.

    Today the field of evolutionary computing consists of many prominent
    techniques and approaches. Many modern approaches use agent-based
    modeling methods in which agents are generated and altered by
    the algorithm and then scored following each iteration. Depending
    on the approach used, low scoring agents are then removed and
    another iteration begins. On another page, I elaborate on basic implementaion of evolutionary computing.
