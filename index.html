<h1>Impact of Weather and Road Conditions on Vehicle Crashes in Montogomery County, Maryland</h1>

<div class="wrapper">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Montgomery County is the most populous county in Maryland, with over 1 million residents. Montgomery also has the second highest cost of 
      living in the state and a broadly wealthy population. Most relevant for our work, however, Montgomery sees significant through-traffic of 
      travelers to Washington D.C. and Baltimore. Because of this increased traffic and its large population, Montgomery County serves as an excellent 
      candidate for analysis of traffic incidents, which is generalizable to both commuters, residents taking shorter trips, and long-haul traffic. 
      Our project aims to analyze the impact of weather and road conditions on car crashes and, in particular, how they impact the severity of crashes. 
      We used data collected by the Maryland State Police automated crash reporting system, the Montgomery County police, and other relevant police jurisdictions. 
      The dataset we used, titled “Crash Reporting – Drivers Data”, was obtained from the Maryland Open Data Portal. The dataset contains 193,636 rows and 39 columns, 
      each representing a specific car crash event from 2015 through early 2025. No significant cleaning was performed on the data. 
      However, some of the visuals required deriving new data from existing columns. For example, vehicle age was computed from the vehicle model year and crash date. 
      Throughout our project, we used several terms and abbreviations such as ACRD (Automated Crash Reporting System), Crash Severity (the level of injury sustained such 
      as minor, possible, serious, or fatal), and Driver At Fault (whether the driver was responsible for the accident). To better understand and clean our dataset, 
      we grouped features into categories such as crash Metadata (date and time, case number), Environmental Conditions (level of daylight, weather, speed limit), 
      Vehicle/Driver Information (Vehicle make, vehicle year), Geographic Data (location, road name), and Crash Outcome Factors (Driver At Fault, Injury Severity). 
      Specifically, we investigated if there is a strong uptick in crash severity due to weather conditions, if there are specific geographic areas or roads that are 
      especially prone to severe accidents, and whether other factors like vehicle age and road speed limits are relevant. We used these reference papers as inspiration 
      for our work in our project: </p>

    <p>This interactive map shows where crashes happened in the 2024 calendar year. Although many points are shown at default,
       users can filter crashes based on the type of injury sustained as a result of the crash: serious, minor, and possible injury. 
       As a result, these different types of injuries are also represented with a different color. By filtering for only crashes leading 
       to serious injuries, we see that a majority of these crashes happen on major highways and roads, instead of residential areas. In 
       addition, it seems like the weather conditions do not seem to have an affect on the severity of these crashes whatsoever because 
       some of these crashes happened in clear weather. On the map, this is represented by solid color lines like pink and yellow. Some 
       recurring roads that have had serious injuries take place include Georgia Avenue, Frederick Road, and Eisenhower Memorial Highway. 
       It makes sense that more serious injuries would happen on these types of roads, but it’s important to acknowledge this to further 
       investigate what can be done on the roads to minimize the number of crashes that lead to fatal or serious injuries.

              This heatmap depicts the proportion of accidents which resulted in major injury or fatality
              for different weather types (displayed on the y-axis) and vehicle age (displayed on the x-axis).
              This plot demonstrates a significantly greater risk for individuals driving older vehicles
              to sustain significant injury in the event of a crash. Perhaps counterintuitively, this graph
              also suggests that older cars do not see a decrease in safety relative to newer cars in
              more extreme weather, like snow and rain. The data suggests that, instead, the difference
              in major injury likelihood between newer and older cars decreases.

      This side by side bar plot displays the proportion of crashes that occur in Montgomery
       County based on the weather hazard type and the injury severity sustained by the 
       driver. Since there are so many different weather types in this dataset, we decided 
       to split the types fitted into three categories: Not Hazardous, Moderate Hazardous, 
       and Very Hazardous. We decided to use a  proportion rather than count to determine if 
       more serious injuries would increase as the weather gets more dangerous for drivers. 
       We also had to remove the “no apparent injury” in our Injury Severity column because 
       they made up an overwhelming proportion for each hazard category. We see that there 
       is no difference in the proportion of major injuries when the driver is not at fault, 
       which is due to less observations in serious injuries as the weather gets more dangerous. 
       However, this proportion slightly increases when the driver is responsible for the crash 
       only when the injuries are more serious by about 0.1%. For possible and minor injuries, 
       the proportion decreases regardless of how hazardous the conditions were outside. We also 
       see that there are a very small number of observations for fatal injuries overall, which
        means that a more hazardous weather condition doesn’t mean a more serious injury. This 
        suggests that there are many more factors to consider that impact the condition of the 
        driver other than how the weather is. Some possibilities include how visible the road 
        conditions were or how fast the driver was going.

    This interactive monthly line chart displays how crash injuries in Montgomery County 
    occur under different weather conditions. Using a drop-down menu, users can select from 
    the four major weather types — Clear, Cloudy, Rain, and Snow. Each line represents a 
    different injury severity level (excluding “No Apparent Injury”), and the vertical axis 
    shows the number of reported crashes per month for each type. When selecting “clear” 
    weather, for example, we can see that suspected minor injuries and possible injuries 
    are the most commonly reported injury types. In contrast, fatal injuries remain 
    consistently low (under 4 crashes per month, which highlights their rarity). There are 
    some cyclical trends during clear weather conditions. In October 2024, there was a 
    notable spike in “Possible Injury” crashes under clear weather conditions. This may 
    reflect a seasonal increase in traffic volume due to school and work routines, combined
    with environmental factors like lower sun angles and morning hazards. Also, June had many 
    more minor injury occurrences than any other month, possibly because of more travel or 
    traffic during that period. The other weather types have much fewer injury occurrences 
    due to their variations. Months such as May and September had significantly higher 
    minor/possible injuries from car crashes as these months tend to be cloudier than others. 
    Summer months (June- August) typically have much fewer clouds in Montgomery County, and 
    that is why the injury occurrences are much less in those months than in others. The same 
    applies to rain; high-rain months such as September and May had many more injuries from 
    car crashes than other months, and summer months had very few due to the inexistence of 
    rain. Snow was much more rare in Montgomery County; It had many occurrences of possible 
    injuries in January 2024 but didn’t have any more car crash injury occurrences up until 
    December 2024, which makes sense considering these months have more snow than others

  The scatterplot on the left shows the proportion of accidents which result in injury and average speed limit for the
  100 most accident-prone roads in Montogmery county. The size of the markers indicates the number of accidents on the
  road and the color indicates what type of road it is. Specific roads can be selected by dragging over a region. 
  The bar graph on the right shows the road names and accident proprotions of the roads
  which are selected on the scatter plot. The scatterplot, displays the relationship between speed limits, route 
  types, and how dangerous crashes are on the road, as measured by injury proportion. Furthermore,
  viewing the graphs in tandem allows the viewer to more clearly understand the relationship in certain injury proportion
  or speed limit intervals and to identify specific roads which are especially troublesome.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>These visualizations demonstrate a somewhat minor correlation between environmental 
    factors — weather and road conditions — and crash occurrence and severity. However, the differences in severity we observed were
    small enough that it is doubtful that weather plays a particularly outsized role.
    Despite this, these insights are still important for drivers. 
    Drivers in Montgomery County, as well as road safety officers, may be enabled to better direct their resources towards dealing 
    with other factors, such as speeding and ensuring vehicle fitness for the road, which our later analysis showed to be perhaps more strongly linked to accident severity. 
    Overall, our results can support targeted safety campaigns, smarter infrastructure planning, and the potential development of real-time interventions,
    such as weather-triggered traffic alerts. Our analysis of particularly dangerous roads could also be helpful for safety purposes. 
    In summary, while we failed to identify strong correlations which pinpoint a possible cause for major accidents, our analysis still provides additional data which can inform better safety measures.</p>
