<h1>Impact of Weather and Road Conditions on Vehicle Crashes in Montogomery County, Maryland</h1>

<div class="wrapper">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Montgomery county is the most popular county in Maryland with over 1 million residents. 
      Montgomery also has the second highest cost of living in the state and is a broadly wealthy population.
      It is also a popular county to drive through in order to get to 
      the nation’s capital: Washington, D.C as well as Baltimore. Because of this increased traffic,
      and its large population, Montgomery county serves as an excellent candidate for analysis of traffic incidents
      which is generalizable to both communters, residents taking shorter trips, and long-haul traffic. Our 
      project aims to analyze the impact of weather and road conditions in car crashes and 
      how they impact the wide-ranging levels in severity of crashes in Montgomery county.
      Specifically, we hope to determine if there is a strong up-tick in crash severity due to weather
      conditions, if there are specific geographic areas or roads which are especially prone to severe accidents,
      and whether other factors like vehicle age and road speed limits are relevant. 
      We used these reference papers as inspiration for our work in our project: </p>

    <p>This interactive map shows where crashes happened in the 2024 calendar year.
        Although many points are shown at default, users can filter crashes based 
        on the type of injury sustained as a result of the crash: serious, minor, and 
        possible injury. As a result, these different types of injuries are also 
        represented with a different color. By filtering for only crashes leading to 
        serious injuries, we see that a majority of these crashes happen on major highways 
        and roads, instead of residential areas. In addition, it seems like the weather 
        conditions do not seem to have an affect on the severity of these crashes whatsoever 
        because some of these crashes happened in clear weather. On the map, this is 
        represented by solid color lines like pink and yellow. Some recurring roads that have 
        had serious injuries take place include Georgia Avenue, Frederick Road, and Eisenhower 
        Memorial Highway. It makes sense that more serious injuries would happen on these 
        types of roads, but it’s important to acknowledge this to further investigate what 
        can be done on the roads to minimize the number of crashes that lead to fatal or 
        serious injuries.

      This side by side bar plot displays the proportion of crashes that occur in Montgomery
      County based on the weather hazard type and the injury severity sustained by the 
      driver. Since there are so many different weather types in this dataset, we decided 
      to split the types fitted into three categories: Not Hazardous, Moderate Hazardous, 
      and Very Hazardous. We decided to use a  proportion rather than count to determine if 
      more serious injuries would increase as the weather gets more dangerous for drivers. We 
      see that there is no difference in the proportion of major injuries when the driver is 
      not at fault. However, this proportion slightly increases when the driver is responsible 
      for the crash. For possible injuries, it increases by 1.5% from not hazardous to very 
      hazardous. Additionally, minor injuries increase by 0.6% from not hazardous to moderate 
      hazardous in this category. This suggests that there are many more factors to consider 
      that impact the condition of the driver other than how the weather is. Some possibilities 
      include how visible the road conditions were or how fast the driver was going.

        This is a stacked area chart that displays the evolution of multiple groups' 
        values on the same graphic - visualizing the proportion of crash severities on 
        each date during clear weather conditions over time (from early 2024 to March 2025). 
        Each color represents a different severity level, and the vertical axis shows the 
        proportion (%) of crashes on that specific day. This graph focuses mostly on clear 
        weather, as it has the most occurrences of car crashes in the past year. The x-axis 
        represents a time series of clear weather conditions from early 2024 to March 2025, 
        while the y-axis portrays the percentage of crashes (0-100%) attributed to each 
        severity level on a given day. The legend on the top right shows the 5 common severity
        levels: fatal injury (very rare), no apparent injury (dominates the graph), possible 
        injury, suspected minor injury, and suspected serious injury (not as common as minor 
        injury but more common than fatal). Possible injury represents data that have not yet 
        been classified as minor or serious injuries but are most likely under one of those 
        categories.

              This heatmap depicts the proportion of accidents which resulted in major injury or fatality
              for different weather types (displayed on the y-axis) and vehicle age (displayed on the x-axis).
              This plot demonstrates a significantly greater risk for individuals driving older vehicles
              to sustain significant injury in the event of a crash. Perhaps counterintuitively, this graph
              also suggests that older cars do not see a decrease in safety relative to newer cars in
              more extreme weather, like snow and rain. The data suggests that, instead, the difference
              in major injury likelihood between newer and older cars decreases.

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
  <p>These visualizations demonstrate a somewhat minor correlation between environmental 
    factors — weather and road conditions — and crash occurrence and severity. However, the differences in severity we observed were
    small enough that it is doubtful that weather plays a particularly outsized role.
    Despite this, these insights are still important for drivers. 
    Drivers in Montgomery County, as well as road safety officers, may be enabled to better direct their resources towards dealing 
    with other factors, such as speeding and ensuring vehicle fitness for the road, which our later analysis showed to be perhaps more strongly linked to accident severity. 
    Overall, our results can be support targeted safety campaigns, smarter infrastructure planning, and the potential development of real-time interventions,
    such as weather-triggered traffic alerts. Our analysis of particularly dangerous roads could also be helpful for safety purposes. 
    In summary, while we failed to identify strong correlations which pinpoint a possible cause for major accidents, our analysis still provides additional data which can inform better safety measures.</p>
